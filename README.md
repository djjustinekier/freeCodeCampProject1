This is my solution from the freeCodeCamp projects.

Everything here may be used or be a reference by anyone who are looking for solution from freeCodeCamp projects.
But I highly recommended, that YOU must try first to solve before looking from my solution.

I AM ALSO A STUDENT on freeCodeCamp so if anyone find a mistake here or anyone find a great way/solution, PLEASE HELP ME also. Thanks :)
